# PollSage

PollSage is a web application that allows users to create and participate in polls. It provides a platform for users to gather opinions and make data-driven decisions.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can create an account and log in to access the PollSage application. Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.
- **Create Polls:** Users can create polls by specifying the question and answer options. They can customize various settings for the poll, such as allowing multiple selections and setting an expiration date.
- **Vote on Polls:** Users can participate in polls by selecting their preferred answer option(s). They can choose a single option or multiple options based on the poll's configuration.
- **View Poll Results:** Users can view the results of a poll, including the number and percentage of votes for each option. The results are displayed in a visually appealing chart format.
